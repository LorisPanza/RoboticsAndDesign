# Robotics and Design 
The *Politecnico di Milano* course offers the opportunity to explore many aspects of developing interactive physical systems (such as social robots) using software and hardware that make them sensitive and responsive to the analog world, including people. Through collaboration between teachers and students from the Schools of Engineering and Design, the course aims to develop interdisciplinary skills to design and implement interactive devices, such as autonomous robots. Students will have the opportunity to study, experiment, design, and produce robots in interdisciplinary groups.

The objective of the proposed project is the creation of a wearable robot able to express feelings depending on the input coming from the environment, from person who wear it or people around it. 

Cocobot is a companion robot for users that will accompany them and interact with them in
specific ways.
The goal is to keep people entertained while also preventing some undesirable behaviours.
The fundamental goals are :
* to encourage people to move their bodies more when they have been sitting for an
extended period of time.
* connect with the third person by recognizing good and bad words.
* show positive feelings when someone pet it
The robot is shaped like a cat and can easily be carried on the shoulder. Being on the eye
level of the third person helps people to interact better.

The [user manual](G5_User%20Manual.pdf) explain how to play with Cocobot, the [mantainance manual](G5_User%20Manual.pdf) describe in a detailed way how Coco is composed from a technical point of view in order to maintain it.

In the repository, it is possible to find code to test the Arduino sensors and the [final deliver code](FinalDeliver/ProjectFinal.ino) for the Arduino board to control the senser able to detect input from the environment and express emotion thorugh actuators as servomotors, vibration motor, etc.
